Write a program to find the aliquot sum of a given number.

Hint: The aliquot divisors of a number are all its divisors except the number itself.
The aliquot sum is the sum of the aliquot divisors.
For example, the aliquot divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and its aliquot sum is 16.

Extend this program to check if given number is a perfect number or not.

If a number equals to its aliquot sum, then it is a perfect number.
Print all perfect numbers between 1 to 100.
